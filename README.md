# AILead-Scorer
I've created a comprehensive AI-powered sales coaching and lead scoring application for GroMo agents
that includes:

Interactive Dashboard - A central hub showing key metrics, motivational quotes, and quick access to main features
Lead Upload & Scoring System - Both CSV upload and manual entry options with AI-based scoring
AI Sales Coach - A chat interface with predefined responses for common sales questions
Daily Sales Suggestions - Product recommendations based on day, season, and trends
Performance Analytics - Visualized metrics and statistics for data-driven decisions
Technical Architecture
Frontend & Backend
The application is built with Streamlit, which provides both the frontend interface and backend logic in Python. This makes it simple to deploy as a single application.

Key Components
1. Main App Structure
Created a responsive app layout with sidebar navigation
Implemented session state management for persistent data
Added custom CSS styling for visual appeal
2. Lead Management System
Built a CSV upload interface with validation and sample template
Created a manual lead entry form with necessary fields
Implemented lead scoring algorithm based on:
Recency of contact
Product interest
Lead source quality
Geographic factors
3. AI Sales Coach
Developed a chat interface with message history
Implemented rule-based response generation for common sales queries
Categories include: closing techniques, objection handling, product pitches, motivation, scripts
4. Daily Sales Suggestions
Created day-specific product recommendations
Added seasonal product suggestions (monsoon, tax season, festivals)
Implemented card-based UI with expandable details
5. Analytics Dashboard
Built interactive charts using Plotly:
Lead status distribution
Source analysis
Product interest tracking
Score distribution
Geographic visualization
Data Flow
User uploads leads or enters them manually
Leads are processed, validated, and scored
Results are stored in session state
Dashboard visualizes the processed data
